# java-academy

## Description

Java Academy is an API for a course provider with progress tracking and is developed
with Javalin as the main framework.

## Inspiration

Currently, I am working at ACL, and we are given a document with the topics we need
to study, the idea is to keep the study plan available for each one and keep track
of the progress for every intern, with different courses that must be completed.

## Workspace

Developed in JetBrains IntelliJ Ultimate Edition using JDK version 15.
